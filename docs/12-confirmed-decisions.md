# Confirmed Decisions

This document records current project decisions confirmed by the user. If a later decision changes, update this file in the same change.

## Project

```text
Project folder name: 51_keyvast_gui
First target OS: Windows
Primary development language: Rust
First GUI direction: Rust native engineering GUI
Initial GUI candidate: egui
First product focus: in vivo electrophysiology
Sleep EEG/EMG product line: not first priority
```

## First MVP

```text
Channels: 64
Sample rate: 30 kHz
Sample value type: i16
Data layout: interleaved_by_sample
Recording format: kvraw
TTL lines: 16
```

## Hardware Direction

```text
Future connector: USB Type-C
Future transport: USB-based data transfer
First hardware module: Opal Kelly XEM7310-A75
First hardware protocol: Opal Kelly FrontPanel / Intan Rhythm USB3-style endpoints
First hardware bit file: keyvast_260607_with_UART.bit (provide the path at runtime via --bitfile / the GUI picker)
  Canonical candidate order lives in code: kv_rhd::RHD_BITFILE_CANDIDATES
  [keyvast_combined_download.bit, keyvast_260607_with_UART.bit, intan_rec_controller_7310.bit]
Host program should bundle the required FrontPanel runtime DLL for convenience
First live hardware channel target: up to two 32-channel RHD headstages
Register map: use Rhythm USB3 / FrontPanel endpoints unless the Keyvast bitfile changes them
Packet format: Rhythm USB3 data frames unless the Keyvast bitfile changes them
CRC algorithm: TBD
Timestamp clock: Rhythm USB3 32-bit sample timestamp for first hardware bring-up
ADC gain conversion: follow Open Ephys / Intan RHD convention for display, while preserving raw data
```

## Impedance Measurement & Finite Captures (P10: DA6/DA7/DA27)

```text
DA6  FrontPanel block-pipe reads must transfer an integer number of USB3 blocks
     (USB3_BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES = 1024). A finite zcheck/bring-up capture leaves
     exactly byte_count bytes in the FIFO, which for typical impedance configs
     is not 1024-aligned. read_pipe_block() now pads the request to the next
     block boundary (protocol::block_aligned_len), enables the block-throttle
     override while reading the trailing partial block, then keeps only the
     meaningful prefix. The continuous acquisition block is already aligned.
DA7  Impedance magnitude is gated on the Intan saturation-voltage model: a
     channel whose measured amplitude rails is reported as saturated rather
     than as a falsely-low impedance, and the empirical frequency correction
     is applied to the converted magnitude.
DA27 The zcheck DAC waveform rejects impedance test frequencies too low to fit
     one full period inside the command bank (MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH = 1024)
     instead of silently clamping the period and measuring the wrong tone.
```

## Verification Ladder

Use this order:

```text
10-second smoke test
10-minute recorder test
2-hour endurance test
```

## API Direction

The user does not need to decide the Python / MATLAB integration mode now.

First phase:

```text
CLI + kvraw + metadata + events + integrity report
```

Later phase:

```text
kv-daemon local API
Python client
MATLAB client
Web GUI or external tools
```

## Rust Workspace Decision

Use a Rust workspace unless implementation reveals a strong reason not to.

Plain meaning: one project folder contains multiple smaller Rust packages, such as:

```text
crates/kv-types
crates/kv-simulator
crates/kv-core
crates/kv-cli
crates/kv-gui
```

This lets each part stay small, while still building as one project.

The folder can stay named `51_keyvast_gui`. Rust crate names should use normal package names such as `kv-types`, `kv-core`, and `kv-cli`.
