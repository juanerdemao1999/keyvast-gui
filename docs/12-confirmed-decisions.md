# Confirmed Decisions

This document records current project decisions confirmed by the user. If a later decision changes, update this file in the same change.

## Project

```text
Project folder name: 51_keyvast_gui
First target OS: Windows
Primary development language: Rust
First GUI direction: Rust native engineering GUI
Initial GUI candidate: egui
First product focus: in vivo electrophysiology
Sleep EEG/EMG product line: not first priority
```

## First MVP

```text
Channels: 64
Sample rate: 30 kHz
Sample value type: i16
Data layout: interleaved_by_sample
Recording format: kvraw
TTL lines: 16
```

## Hardware Direction

```text
Future connector: USB Type-C
Future transport: USB-based data transfer
Exact USB protocol: TBD
FPGA bit file: TBD
Register map: TBD
Packet format: TBD
CRC algorithm: TBD
Timestamp clock: TBD
ADC gain conversion: TBD
```

## Verification Ladder

Use this order:

```text
10-second smoke test
10-minute recorder test
2-hour endurance test
```

## API Direction

The user does not need to decide the Python / MATLAB integration mode now.

First phase:

```text
CLI + kvraw + metadata + events + integrity report
```

Later phase:

```text
kv-daemon local API
Python client
MATLAB client
Web GUI or external tools
```

## Rust Workspace Decision

Use a Rust workspace unless implementation reveals a strong reason not to.

Plain meaning: one project folder contains multiple smaller Rust packages, such as:

```text
crates/kv-types
crates/kv-simulator
crates/kv-core
crates/kv-cli
crates/kv-gui
```

This lets each part stay small, while still building as one project.

The folder can stay named `51_keyvast_gui`. Rust crate names should use normal package names such as `kv-types`, `kv-core`, and `kv-cli`.
